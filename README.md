# algorithms
Here are my C++ implementations of common (and not so) algorithms.

Coins and coins_iter are about how to make a sum out of coins (the latter uses iterative solution and much faster).
max_diff_cont_subarrays.cpp finds two disjoint contiguous sub-arrays such that the absolute difference between the sum of two sub-arrays is maximum and returns the difference (problem taken from careercup.com). O(n) and no dynamic programming.
